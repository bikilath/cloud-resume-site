# Add other packages your functions might implicitly need, if any.
# For example, if you were doing more complex data manipulation:
# pandas
# numpy
# You also need pytest for your tests, but it's typically installed in the CI/CD environment
# just for testing, not bundled with the deployed function app code itself.
# However, if you're building a deployment package that includes tests, sometimes
# it's simpler to put it here. For a clean deployment, usually testing tools are separate.
# Since your workflow explicitly installs it for tests, it's not strictly needed here for deployment.
